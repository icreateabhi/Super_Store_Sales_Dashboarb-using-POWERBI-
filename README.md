# Super_Store_Sales_Dashboarb-using-POWERBI-
I recently created a Super Store Sales Dashboard in Power BI, showcasing key sales metrics and trends. The dashboard includes visualizations such as sales distribution by region, payment mode, and customer segment. It also features line charts displaying sales and profit trends over time, as well as a map showing profit by state.
